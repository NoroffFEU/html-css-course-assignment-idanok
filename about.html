            <p>We are a group of good friends who always
                wanted to make good and sustainable jackets
                for our outdoor adventures. We share a lot of
                interests, such as: hiking, rafting, skiing, camping,
                canoeing and exploring nature. Outdoor clothing is
                therefor very important to us and we are passionate
                about sharing our products with the world for a better
                outdoor experience.  The environment is something we
                all really cares about and we always had a goal to make
                the jackets as sustainable as possible.

            <p>Fast fashion is growing faster then ever and comes
                with an astonishing environmental and social cost.
                We in Rainydays  are therefor committed to making
                the jackets as sustainable as possible. The material
                is made out of recycled materials and uses biodegradable
                components from recycled fibers. These materials grow
                with no pesticide or fertilizer, consume less energy
                and water, and employ no chemical treatment, thus reducing
                the overall carbon footprint. We also use fabrics that
                specializes in  sustainable clothes. These fabrics are
                also local so that we can meet with the producer without
                having to travel by plane. We are determent to do what we
                can for a more sustainable world.
